# 🏥 Personalized Drug Side-Effect Prediction using SVM

## 📌 Overview
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) pose a significant risk in healthcare, often leading to severe health complications. This project leverages **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** to enhance the accuracy of **drug side-effect prediction** by incorporating **personalized patient data** such as medical history, age, and other relevant factors. The goal is to help **healthcare professionals optimize prescriptions** and improve patient safety.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Effective Classification** – SVMs excel at distinguishing complex patterns in medical data.
- ✅ **Personalized Predictions** – Considers individual patient history for better accuracy.
- ✅ **Improved Drug Safety** – Helps doctors anticipate ADRs more effectively.
- ✅ **Optimized Treatment Decisions** – Reduces risks and enhances patient care.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, medical history, etc.).
- Prescribed drug information.
- Reported side effects.
- Other relevant health parameters.

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring medical records.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracting key attributes from patient history and prescriptions.
3. **SVM Model Training**: Leveraging machine learning techniques to predict potential ADRs.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications
- **Prevention of Drug-Related Complications**
- **Personalized Medicine & AI-driven Treatment Plans**
- **Optimized Healthcare Decision Support Systems**
